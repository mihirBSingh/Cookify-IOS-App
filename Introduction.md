# Introduction
## Context
Our project focuses on social media app development. In order to rapidly build a minimum viable product, we aligned our software development process with popular frameworks. This means using Agile and state based models for app development.<sup>1</sup>

Social media is known to cause feelings of isolation. We also want to ensure that the design of our product does not cause harm to our user. Minimzing harm in a social media context means avoiding features of "addictive software design" like infinite scrolling.<sup>2</sup>

Cookify occupies a unique position in the social media landscape: it's centered around the connection we find through food. Many other social media apps provide great services, but Cookify distinguishes itself with its focus on food.

## Motivation
Social media can help build community and spread valuable information. However, many apps are addictive.<sup>3</sup> They also further feelings of loneliness<sup>4</sup>.. 

Focusing on food will help us avoid the pitfalls of traditional social media while maximizing the benefits it can bring people. This narrow scope disincentivizes the creation of large and artifical communities. Food can encourage authenticity and it acts as a cultural unifier, allowing us to share new experiences <sup>5</sup>.

## Previous Work
Similar social media apps include Strava and Pepper. We take inspiration from Strava's "record" feature and narrow topic focus (though theirs is exercise). 

Meanwhile, Pepper is a "social cookbook." However their appraochj to social media is a bit different. There are common features of addictive decision like an explore page as well as a large influence on an "influencer" community.

## Gaps
Cookify invites thoughtful and active interaction with others through features like requesting recipes, comments, and a friend-focused feed. The content is also curated by the user instead of by influencers. 

## Our Work and Significance
We hope to fulfull the potential of social media while minimzing the harm it can cause. Meanwhile, we also actively design our app to emphasize quality use time rather than addictive scrolling. Finally, we operate in small, not well-developed niche for social media apps.
